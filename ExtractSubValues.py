''' extract values from a nested JSON structure in Python, you can use the built-in 
json module to parse the JSON file and then access the nested keys. 
Let's assume you have a JSON file with the following structure:'''

#json
{
    "Key1": {
        "Subkey1": {
            "SubSubKey1": ["value1", "value2", "value3", "value4", "value5"]
        }
    }
}

'''To extract the values under SubSubKey1, you can do the following:

    Read the JSON file.
    Parse the JSON content using json.load() or json.loads().
    Access the nested keys to get to SubSubKey1.

#Here's a sample Python script to achieve this:
'''

#python
import json

# Assuming your JSON data is stored in a file named 'data.json'
with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Accessing the values under SubSubKey1
values = data['Key1']['Subkey1']['SubSubKey1']

print(values)
'''This script will output the list ['value1', 'value2', 'value3', 'value4', 'value5'], 
which are the values under SubSubKey1. Make sure to handle exceptions 
such as KeyError in case some keys are missing in your JSON data.'''
