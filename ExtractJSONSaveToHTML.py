o achieve what you've described, you'll need to set up a global variable to store 
the results from each of your functions and then create a final function that 
exports these results to an HTML file in a structured and visually appealing format.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

    Define a Global Variable:
    This variable will hold all the results from your functions.

    Modify Your Functions:
    Update your existing functions so that they add their results to the global variable.

    Create an Export Function:
    This function will take the collected data and write it to an HTML file.

Here's an example implementation in Python:


'''
import json
import html

# Step 1: Define a global variable
collected_data = {}

# Example function to extract data from JSON
def extract_data_function1(json_data):
    # Extract specific data (example)
    extracted_data = json_data.get("key1", {})
    # Add to global variable
    collected_data['function1'] = extracted_data

# ... (similar functions for extract_data_function2, ..., extract_data_function5)

# Step 3: Function to export data to HTML
def export_to_html(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as html_file:
        html_file.write('<html><head><title>Extracted Data</title></head><body>')
        html_file.write('<h1>Extracted Data Summary</h1>')
        for function_name, data in collected_data.items():
            html_file.write(f'<h2>Data from {html.escape(function_name)}</h2>')
            html_file.write('<ul>')
            for key, value in data.items():
                html_file.write(f'<li><b>{html.escape(str(key))}</b>: {html.escape(str(value))}</li>')
            html_file.write('</ul>')
        html_file.write('</body></html>')

# Example usage
with open('your_json_file.json', 'r') as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)
    extract_data_function1(data)
    # ... call other functions ...

# Export to HTML
export_to_html('exported_data.html')


'''
This code will create an HTML file with a simple structure. 
Each function's results are listed under a separate heading. 
You might want to enhance the HTML formatting to make it more professional, 
depending on your specific needs. Also, ensure that you have proper error 
handling in place for reading the JSON file and writing the HTML file.

This example assumes that each function extracts a dictionary of data. 
If the data structure is different, you'll need to adjust the export_to_html function accordingly.
